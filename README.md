# Marketing Campaign Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project involves conducting an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a social media advertising campaign dataset. The goal is to uncover key performance drivers, analyse campaign effectiveness, and provide actionable recommendations to improve future marketing strategies.

Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the project explores campaign data, audience demographics, and return on investment (ROI) metrics. Insights gained through statistical analysis and visualisation can be used to optimise campaign strategies moving forward.

## Project Goals
- Perform **data cleaning** and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.
- Use **descriptive statistics** and **visualisations** to identify trends and relationships in the dataset.
- Conduct **A/B testing** to evaluate the effectiveness of different campaign strategies.
- Perform **correlation analysis** and **feature engineering** to improve predictive model accuracy.
- Provide **recommendations** for optimising future marketing efforts.

## Key Insights
- Detailed visualisations highlight which factors most strongly impact campaign success, including user engagement by age, gender, and platform.
- Statistical tests reveal significant differences between campaign versions, helping to refine future targeting strategies.
- Audience segmentation based on demographics uncovers opportunities for higher engagement.

## Files in Repository
- `marketing_eda.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all analysis and visualisations.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, outlining the project details and structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need the following libraries installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **SciPy**

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joela03/Marketing-EDA-PYTHON.git 
```
2. Open the marketing_eda.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to see the data analysis process and visualisations.

## Results
The EDA provides several actionable insights into improving campaign performance, including:

- Identification of key audience demographics contributing to higher engagement.
- Insights on which ad formats and messaging styles perform best across various social media platforms.
- Statistical evidence to support strategic changes in future ad spending.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict future campaign performance based on historical data.
- Expand the analysis to include cross-platform comparisons of ad performance.
- Add additional audience segmentation and personalisation options to target ads more effectively.
