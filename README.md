# Facebook AD Campaign Analysis
## The purpose of this project is to analyse the given dataset in order to answer business questions that may aid in improving future ad campaigns.

### The data used in this project is from an anonymous organisation’s social media ad campaign and consists of the following columns.
- ad_id: an unique ID for each ad.
- xyzcampaignid: an ID associated with each ad campaign of XYZ company.
- fbcampaignid: an ID associated with how Facebook tracks each campaign.
- age: age of the person to whom the ad is shown.
- gender: gender of the person to whim the add is shown
- interest: a code specifying the category to which the person’s interest belongs (interests are as mentioned in the person’s Facebook public profile).
- Impressions: the number of times the ad was shown.
- Clicks: number of clicks on for that ad.
- Spent: Amount paid by company xyz to Facebook, to show that ad.
- Total conversion: Total number of people who enquired about the product after seeing the ad.
- Approved conversion: Total number of people who bought the product after seeing the ad.

We seek to analyse the correlation between relevant variables and conversion rate, campaign performance, how the audience is segmented, demographic insights and how to improve future campaigns.

The business questions that we seek to answer are:
- Which variables had the highest correlation to approved conversion?
- Which campaign had the highest Return on Investment (ROI)?
- Which campaign resulted in the most conversions?
- Which age group responded best to each ads?
- Which gender had a highest conversion rate?
- Which demographic is most profitable?
- What characteristics define successful ads?
- What changes should be made to improve under-performing ads?
